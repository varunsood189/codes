# Problem Solving Patterns

## Pattern 1: Sliding Window
A technique used to reduce the time complexity of a problem by using a window of fixed size or dynamically resizing it.

---

## Pattern 2: Two Pointer
This technique involves using two pointers to iterate through data from different ends or directions to solve a problem.

---

## Pattern 3: Fast & Slow Pointers
A common pattern for finding cycles in linked lists or arrays by using two pointers moving at different speeds.

---

## Pattern 4: Merge Intervals
Used to solve problems involving overlapping intervals by sorting and merging them efficiently.

---

## Pattern 5: Cyclic Sort
A sorting algorithm that places elements in their correct position with minimal swaps, often used for numbers in a fixed range.

---

## Pattern 6: In-place Reversal of a LinkedList
This pattern is used to reverse linked lists without using extra space.

---

## Pattern 7: Tree Breadth First Search
A traversal technique that explores nodes level by level in a tree.

---

## Pattern 8: Depth First Search (DFS)
A traversal technique that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

---

## Pattern 9: Two Heaps
A method that uses two heaps (min-heap and max-heap) to efficiently solve problems involving running medians or top elements.

---

## Pattern 10: Subsets
A pattern used to generate all subsets of a given set, often leveraging recursion or backtracking.

---

## Pattern 11: Modified Binary Search
A variation of binary search applied to problems like finding an element in a rotated or infinite sorted array.

---

## Pattern 12: Bitwise XOR
A technique leveraging the properties of XOR for problems like finding a missing number in an array.

---

## Pattern 13: Top 'K' Elements
A pattern to efficiently find the top 'K' largest or smallest elements using heaps or priority queues.

---

## Pattern 14: K-way Merge
A pattern for merging sorted arrays or lists, often used in external sorting or priority queues.

---

## Pattern 15: 0/1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)
A classic DP problem that focuses on optimizing the selection of items based on weight and value constraints.

---

## Pattern 16: Topological Sort (Graph)
A graph traversal pattern to find the order of tasks in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
