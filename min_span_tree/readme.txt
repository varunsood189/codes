Project Title:
Implementation of Krushkal and prims algorithm using c++ language.
Along with the data structure implementation of the Graph, Priority queue and MFset.

Getting started on the project:
1. Open the file in code blocks.
(Be sure to add the .cpp extension file in code blocks.)
Files used here are:
1. graph.cpp
2. main.cpp
3. Krsukal.cpp
4. mfset_i.cpp
5. prim.cpp
6. priorityqueue.cpp

Prerequisites:
Code-blocks 16.01 was used in the development of this assignment. 
You could use the test file included in this folder input_graph.txt

Now running code on your file:
1. Please change the name of the file in the main.cpp file under the 
//Input from the file
comment instead of the input_graph.txt write your file name. Make sure the running 
directory of the program is the same as the one in which file is present.

Format of the file should be same as given in the example
0 6 1 5 -1 -1

6 0 5 -1 3 -1

1 5 0 5 6 4

5 -1 5 0 -1 2

-1 3 6 -1 0 6

-1 -1 4 2 6 0
